## Generator

`EasyAdminPlus` is packaged with a generator which create the default `EasyAdmin` configuration file based on your `Entities` reflection.

### Intro

:exclamation: The purpose of this generator is not to write all the settings for you but to get rid of the tedious writing time of the configurations of your many entities.

**Up to you to enrich these settings by yourself after the complete generation.**

 Generator tries to guess to correct type based on several reflection processes:
 * PHP typehinting
 * Doctrine types
 * Annotations
 * Asserts
